# ub-mode

Every time you are asked to make a change follow:

- First Make it Work.
- Then Make it Right.

# First Make it Work

## Laziness Protocol

- One decision lives in one place.
- Ship the smallest edit that solves the problem.

## Foundational Thinking

- Get the data shape right before you write the logic.
- Do first whatever helps every later phase.
- If a concurrent writer would matter, do not share state.

## TDD

- Write the failing test before you change the code.
- See it fail for the reason you expect.
- Make the smallest change that makes it pass.
- If an honest test is impractical, do not write a bad one.

## Redesign From First Principles

- Do not bolt a new requirement onto the old design.
- Ask what you would have built if it had been there from the start, think that through, and deliver it in pieces.

## Attack the Premise

- When two fixes that share one premise fail the same gate, write that premise in one sentence and count which actors hold the imbalance.
- Remove the assignment.
- Do not start another fix until you have done that.

## Subtract Before You Add

- Take complexity out before you add anything.

## Outcome-Oriented Execution

- Aim at the end state you can check.
- A break in the middle is allowed when you planned it and can undo it.

## Build the Lever

- If the work is not obvious at a glance, build the tool that does it.
- Do one unit by hand, then make the tool match that unit.

## Architecture

### Model the Domain

- Put the domain in a structure that makes the illegal states impossible.
- Maintain a glossary of domain terms.
- If the code is already clear and local, leave it.

### Boundary Discipline

- Check the data where it enters.
- Inside, trust it.
- Keep the business logic in a pure function.

### Type System Discipline

- Make the illegal value impossible to write.
- Parse outside data once, where it comes in.
- Do not silence the compiler.

### Make Operations Idempotent

- Running it twice, or running it after a crash halfway through, ends in the same state.

### Separate Before Serializing Shared State

- If they do not need the same mutable thing, give each its own.
- If they do, allow one writer, and enforce that in the structure.

# Then Make it Right

## Fix Root Causes

- Reproduce it.
- Fix the cause.
- A guard that only hides the crash is not a fix.

## Sequence work into verifiable units

- Finish one small unit and check it.
- Then start the next.

## Test Behavior, Not Implementation

- The test calls the code the way its user does and checks the result that user would see.
- If the test would still pass when every function returned nothing, throw it out.

## Crapper

- Use the crapper tool
- Reduce each function under CRAP 10 by splitting it, by testing it, or both.
- Consider whether case statements are worth reducing.

## Dryer

- Use the dryer tool to eliminate duplication that rank 0.8 or above.

## Mutator

- Use the mutator tool
- Cover the uncovered.
- Kill the survivors.
- Delete dead code.

## Refactoring

- Pin what the code does.
- Change the structure.
- Prove the behavior did not change.

# Installed Tool Commands

Install the tools with `uv run <skill-directory>/install.py`.
From the target project root, run each tool using
`uv run <skill-directory>/run.py <tool> [arguments]`,
where `<tool>` is `crapper`, `dryer`, or `mutator`, and
`<skill-directory>` is the directory containing this SKILL.md.
Do not change the working directory to the skill directory when analyzing a project.
Configure the target project's test and coverage commands as needed.

## Tool Language Support

- Run crapper, dryer, and mutator only on languages supported by each tool.
- Skip a tool's checks for unsupported languages; in mixed-language projects, still check the supported portions.
- Skipped checks are not passing checks. All other design, testing, and refactoring rules still apply.
